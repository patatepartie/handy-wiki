Handy Wiki is both an exercice in writing software in TDD and ATDD (BDD) style and a real need for myself.
I've recently started to write about things I want to remember, be it a draft of a letter I need to send or maybe ideas to blog about.
So I was looking for a wiki that would help me do that.
What I basically need is: 
- to be able to write to it even when offline, because I don't always have an internet connection;
- to move text around easily so that I can write incrementally.

I'm hoping handy wiki will be able to fullfil those needs.
